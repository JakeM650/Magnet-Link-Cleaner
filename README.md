# Magnet-Link-Cleaner
This simple Python script removes all tracker (tr=) parameters from a magnet link.
It helps keep torrent downloads more decentralized by relying only on DHT and peer exchange instead of centralized trackers.

**Note:** Removing trackers can slightly slow down downloads or make it harder to find peers, especially for less popular torrents.
